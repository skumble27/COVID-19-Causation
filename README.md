### Project Overview

 The current pandemic is an event that is unprecedented in recent times. Indeed, as a large number governments are battling to curb the spread of infections by implementing various control measures, it is still uncertain what factors are indeed contributing to the increase rates of infection and death whilst a number of other countries have successfully managed to curtail the spread of infection. This project seeks to determine what factors, if any, are contributing to the spread of Covid-19. The key questions this project aims to assess are as follows:

##### 					

##### 					1. How are different country characteristics affecting infection 

##### 					2. Are health related factors manipulating infection rates?

##### 					3.Does hot weather influence covid-19 infection rates?
